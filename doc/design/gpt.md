I want to design a web application using react and bun.
The basic webui is only a setting icon. It have many options, including which view do i want to set as the default.
By defalult, the menu bar is showed left(It can be invisible in the setting options).
There are two web views now, one is called moment(It allow user to write simple message and send to the server)
Another is the readme renderer, it can render readme files from the python server.
